    bulletPointOne: It's a Way of Life
    bulletPointTwo: Treausuring Time
    bulletPointThree: Feasible Steps
    bulletPointOneBody: Working in sprints is not only a collaborative approach to
      developing amazing software, it's also a lifestyle.
    bulletPointTwoBody: Each day is a gift that we're determined to use wisely.
      Whether it's work, rest, or play we make sure that we're intentional with
      the time we're given.
    bulletPointThreeBody: Training in sprints allows us to be good stewards of our
      time. By breaking the big picture down into bite-size pieces, we're able
      to get more done, produce higher-quality results, and have fun in the
      process.
  approachTwo:

    bulletPointOne: De-cluttering Daily Activities
    bulletPointTwo: It's a Team Effort
    bulletPointThree: Simplify the Complex
    bulletPointOneBody: "The bad news: life can be messy. The good news: but it
      doesn't have to be. We are so passionate about technology because it has
      allowed us to declutter our daily routines so that we can get the most out
      of life."
    bulletPointTwoBody: "Competition is a powerful driver, but rather than competing
      against other companies, products or services, we choose to compete
      against the complexity that can so easily creep in and cripple the things
      we work so hard to build. "
    bulletPointThreeBody: With the help of modern software, we believe it's truly
      possible to create a world in which the complicated is made simple, so
      that we can all spend our time focusing on the right things.
  approachThree:
    header: Clarify your Cognition

    bulletPointOne: Clever Compression of Complex Concepts
    bulletPointThree: Meaningful Work > Busy Work
    bulletPointTwo: Tools for Transformation
    bulletPointOneBody: The human brain is pretty amazing. It's also pretty
      complicated. That's why we focus on coming up with ways to harness its
      power by making it easier to hold onto the good ideas while filtering out
      the bad ones.
    bulletPointTwoBody: Like any good carpenter or sculptor will tell you, having
      the right tools can make all the difference. In order to optimize for
      insight, we build & use tools that contribute to clarity of thought and
      reject those that create clutter.
    bulletPointThreeBody: >
      More work is not the answer. Our objective is to eliminate busy work so
      that people can focus on the work that matters.

    bulletPointOne: People = Priority
    bulletPointTwo: User-Focused Designs
    bulletPointThree: Passionate People, Powerful Products
    bulletPointOneBody: Sprinter is rooted in empathy. This means that every person
      we do business with knows that they are our priority, and that we will do
      everything we can to help them achieve their goals.
    bulletPointThreeBody: "We strive to help individuals reach their maximum
      potential by freeing them from monotonous work so that they can perform at
      their peak on the projects they’re passionate about. "
    bulletPointTwoBody: Great software is useless unless somebody can use it. That's
      why we take time to understand the user's perspective before designing any
      product or feature they'll be expected to use.
